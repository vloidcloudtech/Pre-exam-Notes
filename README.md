# This is a directory of the notes I have taken throughout most of my certification Exams


## FYI: My overall study method is physically writing notes, but I will fill out the exam objectives before an exam IF needed. Which is why there are some guides that aren't filled in.

### My overall strategy for online study guides is to copy the exam objectives and fill them out without the use of any materials, then go back and fill in the blanks. After that, I will run it through AI and ask for improvements. I keep the AI output in a separate document that I go over maybe an hour before the exam.
